# What is this repo?

I am looking to use this code of a old repo of my to apply CI/CD.

## What is this API?

Been so long that i don't remember, i only tweek to make running again.

## Why use a old repo instead of building one?

My ideia here is only to apply concepts of CI/CD, with jenkis, github actions e etc, this is not about the code, i am only using this code because it have some testing done, i am running this image with nodemon, really, avoid copying this code, only look at CI/CD.
